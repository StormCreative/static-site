Static boiler
===========

This is the basic set-up and project files to be used for static, stand-alone websites.

The project has an additional Rake task for starting a PHP server - instead of needing to use MAMP. You just require the latest version of PHP to be installed.

To action the server use: `rake server`

You can then access the website at `localhost:9292`
